# Better Skill Creator

## What a Skill Is

A skill is a reusable package of instructions and optional resources for a recurring kind of task. It can change the model's defaults, bundle a workflow, or provide scripts, references, and assets that make the work more reliable.

## What a Skill Is Not

- Not a dump of background knowledge. Put niche detail in bundled `references/` files, not the SKILL.md body.
- Not a tutorial. Don't teach; configure.
- Not exhaustive. If a line doesn't change behavior, it's wasted tokens.

## Writing a Skill

### Frontmatter

```yaml
---
name: skill-name
description: "When to trigger. Keep it broad — one sentence."
---
```

- `description` is the trigger. Put all "when to use" information there: what the skill does and the situations that should trigger it. Make it broad enough that it fires whenever relevant. The model undertriggers — err on the side of pushy.
- Use lowercase letters, digits, and hyphens for `name`. Keep it short. Name the folder exactly after the skill name.

### Path Scope

- For Claude Code skills that should auto-load only for matching files, add `paths` to `SKILL.md` frontmatter.
- For Amp granular guidance, add `globs` to Markdown files that are `@`-mentioned from `AGENTS.md`.
- For shared files used by both tools, include both `paths` and `globs` with the same patterns only when the body is useful as path-scoped guidance.

### Body

The model has senior-level knowledge but generic habits. Every line in SKILL.md should change behavior, reduce repeated work, or point to the right bundled resource. Cut everything else.

- State what you want directly. Don't explain why unless the "why" changes behavior.
- Prefer imperative sentences. "Use X" not "You should consider using X".
- If a section has one sentence, it doesn't need a heading — fold it into a neighbor.
- One example is worth including only if the convention is ambiguous without it. Zero is usually fine.

### Size

Ideal SKILL.md is under 100 lines. Hard limit for SKILL.md itself is 200 lines.

### Bundled Resources

A skill can include more than SKILL.md:

```
skill-name/
├── SKILL.md
├── scripts/      — deterministic/repetitive tasks
├── references/   — niche knowledge the model lacks
└── assets/       — templates, fonts, etc.
```

SKILL.md stays short. Put detail in bundled resources and link reference files directly from SKILL.md. Avoid deep chains.

### Exclusions

- Do not add auxiliary docs like `README.md`, `CHANGELOG.md`, or installation notes.
